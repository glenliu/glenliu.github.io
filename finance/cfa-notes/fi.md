_Eurobonds_ are issued outside the jurisdiction of any one country and denominated in a currency
different from the currency of the countries in which they are sold. A bond issued by a
Chinese firm that is denominated in yen and traded in markets outside Japan would fit the definition
of a Eurobond.

Bonds can be sold through an *underwritten offering* or a *best efforts offering*.
+ While smaller bond issues may be sold by a single investment bank, for
larger issues, the lead underwriter heads a syndicate of investment banks who collectively establish
the pricing of the issue and are responsible for selling the bonds to dealers, who in turn sell them to
investors. The syndicate takes the risk that the bonds will not all be sold.
+ In a best efforts offering, the investment banks sell the bonds on a commission basis. Unlike an
underwritten offering, the investment banks do not commit to purchase the whole issue (i.e.,
underwrite the issue).

      - With a *serial bond issue*, bonds are issued with several maturity dates so
that a portion of the issue is redeemed periodically. with a serial bond issue, investors know at issuance
when specific bonds will be redeemed.
     - A bond issue that does not have a serial maturity structure is
said to have a _term maturity structure_ with all the bonds maturing on the same date

      - Short term: ~5 years
