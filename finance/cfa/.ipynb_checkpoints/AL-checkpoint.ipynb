    "Using the sales comparison approach, the price PSF of the comparable properties is adjusted relative to the subject property to account for age and condition. For example, Property 1 is 10 years old, and the subject property is 7 years old. Because the subject property is newer by three years, the price PSF of Property 1 is adjusted up by 3\\% per year for three years, or 9\\%. Property 1 is in average condition, but the subject property is in excellent condition. Thus, the value of Property 1 is adjusted up 14\\%, the adjustment factor provided for the condition adjustment. Thus, the price PSF of Property 1 is adjusted up by 23\\% from \\$1,150: Adjusted price PSF for Property 1 = \\$1,150 × 1.23 = \\$1,415.50. A similar calculation is made for Property 2.
