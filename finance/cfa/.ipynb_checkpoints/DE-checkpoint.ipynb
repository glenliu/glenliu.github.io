    "|Covered call|S-C|1.The primary motivation for covered call options is income generation. The investor believes that the price of the underlying will remain flat (will not increase above the call exercise price). The option premium is considered to be income. However, in considering the return distribution, the investor gives up all gains above the exercise price. The intention is to earn income, not reduce the portfolio’s exposure to the S&P 500.<br><br> 2. To improve on the market, an investor will establish a covered call option position in which the exercise price is below the current price. Because of the option’s time value, the option premium will be greater than the difference between the current price and the exercise price. Presuming that the stock price remains above the exercise price, the stock will be sold at the exercise price on the option expiration date. By utilizing a covered call option, the investor has improved the selling price from today’s current price to an amount that equals the exercise price plus the option premium. In this context, using covered calls intentionally considers that the S&P 500 position will be reduced.<br><br>3.To realize a target price, an investor will establish a covered call option position in which the exercise price is near (typically slightly below) the investor’s target selling price. Target price realization is considered to contain the motivations of both income generation and improving on the market. Should the stock price not increase above the exercise price at expiration, a new covered call option may be established in order to generate income. Should the stock price increase above the exercise price at expiration, then the stock is sold at the exercise price (the investor’s target selling price). In this context, using covered calls intentionally considers that the portfolio’s exposure to the S&P 500 might be reduced.||\n",
