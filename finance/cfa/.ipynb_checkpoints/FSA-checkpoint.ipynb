It would thus be inappropriate to account for its holdings under the equity method, but given the long-term duration of the planned investment, an available-for-sale investment (or fair value through other comprehensive income) would seem to be the most appropriate. The investment should be remeasured and recognized at fair value on the balance sheet with any unrealized gains or losses arising from the difference between the carrying amount and fair value reported in shareholders’ equity (other comprehensive income)."

    "Under IFRS, there must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events after the initial recognition that have an effect on the investment’s future cash flows and that can be reliably measured. Ferdinand is correct in his statement that Elbe has been able to maintain dividend payments. Current dividends are €0.50 on earnings per share of €12,373/6,000 = €2.06, for a payout ratio of 24%, implying that cash flows do not appear to be impaired. Therefore, the investment should not be considered impaired for that reason. If the investment’s fair market value is below its carrying (book) value and the decline is deemed other than temporary, an impairment loss must be recognized. According to Christoph, however, the market value “has just now fallen” below the book value, and there is no indication that the situation of fair value below carrying value is other than temporary. Under the equity method, the investment is not carried at market value. Goodwill is not tested separately for impairment for investments using the equity method.\n",
