# READING 30. ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe common features of alternative investments and their markets and how alternative investments may be grouped by the role they typically play in a portfolio;

Common features of alternative investments include:
- Low liquidity.
- Good diversification potential.
- High due diligence costs.
- Difficult to value.
- Limited access to information.

Alternative investments can provide:
- Exposure to asset classes that stocks and bonds cannot provide.
- Exposure to special investment strategies (e.g., hedge and venture capital funds).
- Special strategies and unique asset classes (e.g., funds that invest in private equity and distressed securities).

## b explain and justify the major due diligence checkpoints involved in selecting active managers of alternative investments;

- Assess the market opportunity offered. Are there exploitable inefficiencies in the market for the type of investments in which the manager specializes?
- Assess the investment process. Does the manager seem to have a competitive edge over others in that market?
- Assess the organization of the manager and its operations. Is it stable and well run? What has been the staff turnover?
- Assess the people by meeting with them and assessing their character.
- Assess the terms and structure (amount and time period) of the investment.
- Assess the service providers (i.e., lawyers, brokers, ancillary staff, etc.) by investigating the outside firms that support the manager’s business.
- Review documents such as the prospectus or private-placement memorandum and the audits.

## c explain distinctive issues that alternative investments raise for investment advisers of private wealth clients;

- taxes
- suitability
- communication
- decision risk
- concentrated positions

## d distinguish among types of alternative investments;

Real estate can be broken down into direct and indirect investment. 
- Examples of direct investment in real estate include ownership of residences, commercial real estate, or agricultural land, and it involves direct management of the assets. 
- Indirect real estate investments include:
  - Companies that develop and manage real estate.
  - Real estate investment trusts (REITs).
  - Commingled real estate funds (CREFs).
  - Separately managed accounts.
  - Infrastructure funds.

Private equity subgroups include start-up companies, middle-market private companies, and private investment in public entities. 
- A direct investment in private equity is when the investor purchases a claim directly from the firm (e.g., preferred shares of stock).
- Indirect investment is usually done through private equity funds, which include venture capital (VC) and buyout funds.

Commodity investments can also be grouped into direct and indirect subgroups. 
- Direct investment is either through the purchase of the physical commodity or the purchase of derivatives (e.g., futures) on those assets. 
- Indirect investment in commodities is usually done through investment in companies whose principal business is associated with a commodity (e.g., investing in a metal via ownership of shares in a mining company).

Many commodities have a low correlation with stocks and bonds and a positive correlation with inflation.


Managed futures funds share many characteristics with hedge funds. 
- The primary feature that distinguishes managed futures from hedge funds is the difference in the assets they hold. Managed futures funds tend to trade only in derivatives markets, while hedge funds tend to trade in spot markets and use futures for hedging. 
- Also, managed futures funds generally take positions based on indices, while hedge funds tend to focus more on individual asset price anomalies. In other words, hedge funds tend to have more of a micro focus, while managed futures tend to have a macro focus.

Buyout funds are the largest segment of the private equity market. 
- Middle-market buyout funds concentrate on divisions spun off from larger, publicly traded corporations and private companies that, due to their relatively small size, cannot efficiently obtain capital. 
- Mega-cap buyout funds concentrate on taking publicly traded firms private. 
- In either case, the target represents an investment opportunity through the identification of under-valued assets, the ability to restructure the debt of the firm, and/or improved (i.e., more efficient) management and operations.

Infrastructure funds specialize in purchasing public infrastructure assets (e.g., airports, toll roads) from cities, states, and municipalities. 

Distressed securities are securities of companies that are in or near bankruptcy. As with managed futures, analysts often consider distressed securities to be part of the hedge fund class of alternative
investments. It may also be part of the private equity class.

## e discuss the construction and interpretation of benchmarks and the problem of benchmark bias in alternative investment groups;

Benchmarks of real estate：房地产的基准（指数）
- NCREIF：直接投资的指数，value weighted and includes sub-indices grouped by real estate sector and geographical region，分为 NCREIF smooth 版本和 NCREIF unsmooth/corrected 版本
- NAREIT：间接投资的指数，real-time, market-cap-weighted index of all REITs actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
注意：NCREIF smooth 版本会低估波动率（underestimate volatility）

 ***Smoothing*** occurs when only infrequent pricing is available or used to calculate return and risk measures.
- The infrequent data points will appear to indicate ***low volatility*** and lead to a downward (not overstated) calculation for standard deviation. Standard deviation is a measure of standalone risk (i.e., before considering diversification and the impact on portfolio risk).
- Smoothed data will also appear uncorrelated (correlation closer to zero) with regularly priced traditional asset classes. Most risky assets have some degree of positive correlation (above zero) with each other. So, including an alternative asset class with smoothed data and apparently lower correlation will overstate diversification benefit.
- Any strategy using exchange-traded derivatives is going to have readily available pricing data and is not likely to be subject to smoothing. 


Real Estate: 
- Benchmarks: NCREIF, NAREIT. 
- Construction: NCREIF is value weighted, NAREIT is cap weighted. 
- Biases: Measured volatility is downward biased. The values are obtained periodically (annually).

Private Equity: 
- Benchmarks: Provided by Cambridge Associates, Preqin, and LPX.
- Construction: Constructed for buyout and venture capital. Value depends upon events. Often construct custom benchmarks. 
- Biases: Repricing occurs infrequently, which results in dated values.

Commodities:
- Benchmarks: S&P GSCI, BCOM, and RJ/CRB Index. 
- Construction: Assume a futures-based strategy. Most types considered investable. 
- Biases: Indices vary widely with respect to purpose, composition, and method of weighting.

Managed Futures: 
- Benchmarks: MLMI, CTA Indices include the CISDM, BarclayHedge, and Barclay Traders. 
- Construction: MLMI replicates the return to a trend-following strategy. CTA Indices use equal-weighted returns. 
- Biases: Requires special weighting scheme.

Distressed Securities: 
- Benchmarks: Characteristics similar to long-only hedge fund benchmarks. 
- Construction: Weighting either equally weighted or based upon assets under management. Selection criteria can vary. 
- Biases: Self-reporting, backfill or inclusion bias, popularity bias, and survivorship bias.

## f evaluate the return enhancement and/or risk diversification effects of adding an alternative investment to a reference portfolio (for example, a portfolio invested solely in common equity and bonds);

Return enhancer:
- Managed futures is an active management strategy. It can be quite aggressive and could be used by hedge funds. It is the only choice that might reasonably target high return as an objective, though there is no guarantee of success. 
- In contrast, real estate and commodities are generally used to provide diversification.
- Commodity investing typically uses long only futures positions and is an active management strategy unrelated to managed futures. 

- Over the 1996–2015 time period, adding managed futures to a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other alternative investments (commodities, private equity, real estate, hedge funds) increased the return and the average return-to-volatility ratio. 
- During the equity market collapse of 2008, managed futures far outperformed all other asset classes studied. 
- Private equity provided return enhancement over the long term. 
- Hedge funds have been found to provide both diversification and return enhancement.

## g describe advantages and disadvantages of direct equity investments in real estate;

Advantages of direct equity real estate investing:
- Many expenses are tax deductible.
- Ability to use more leverage than most other investments.
- Provides more control than stock investing.
- Ability to diversify geographically.

Disadvantages of direct equity real estate investing:
- Lack of divisibility means a single investment may be a large part of the investor’s portfolio.
- High information cost, high commissions, high operating and maintenance costs, and hands-on management requirements.
- Special geographical risks, such as neighboρod deterioration 
- political risk of changing tax codes.

## h discuss the major issuers and suppliers of venture capital, the stages through which private companies pass (seed stage through exit), the characteristic sources of financing at each stage, and the purpose of such financing;

Early: 
- Seed money => Prototype, 
- Startup funds => Product dev and marketing,
- First stage => manufacturing and sales

Expansion: 
- Second stage, 3rd stage for further expansion; 
- Mezzanine or bride financing => prepare for IPO

Exit: 
- IPO, 
- Merger, acquisition

## i compare venture capital funds and buyout funds;

In contrast to venture capital funds, buyout funds usually have:
- A higher level of leverage.
- Earlier and steadier cash flows.
- Less error in the measurement of returns as more of the return is from cash flow return.
- Less frequent losses.
- Less upside potential.

## j discuss the use of convertible preferred stock in direct venture capital investment;

Reasons for CPS:
- Flexible：灵活性，如果目标公司经营的好，将可转换优先股变为股票获得资本利得；如果公司经营的不好，每年可以拿到优先股股利
- Risk：降低投资风险，可主动选择资本利得或股利
- More senior：新一轮 PE 的可转换优先股的优先级要高于之前投资的 PE，因为越后面的轮次越有价值（later rounds are more valuable）
- 在对公司的可转换优先股进行估值时，不会对新的和旧的可转换优先股进行区分

## k explain the typical structure of a private equity fund, including the compensation to the fund’s sponsor (general partner) and typical timelines;

|       |LP               |LLC               |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
|Sponsor|GP               |Managing director |

Timeline:
- Commitment period: 5-7 years, getting commitments and "capital calls"
- End or option to extend 5+ years

Fee structure
- Management fee 2%, decline over time
- Incentive fee (carried interest): 20%
  - hurdle rate
  - high water mark
  - claw back


## l discuss issues that must be addressed in formulating a private equity investment strategy;

Any strategy for private equity investment must address the following issues:
- Low liquidity: the portfolio allocation to this class should typically be 5% or less with a plan to keep the money invested for 7–10 years.
- Diversification through a number of positions: direct private equity is generally for very large portfolios. The total portfolio allocation may be only 5%, but each private equity position is large and multiple positions are needed for diversification. Smaller portfolios for which private equity is otherwise suitable can consider private equity funds.
- Diversification strategy: knowing the unique aspects of a proposed private equity investment as they relate to the overall portfolio.
- Plans for meeting capital calls: committed funds are called as needed, and the investor needs to be prepared to meet the calls.

## m compare indirect and direct commodity investment;

Direct commodity investment entails either purchasing the actual commodities or gaining exposure via derivatives. 

Indirect commodity investment is the purchase of indirect claims (e.g., shares in a corporation) that deal in the commodity.

Direct investment gives more exposure, but cash investment in commodities can incur carrying costs.

Indirect investment may be more convenient, but it may provide very little exposure to the commodity, especially if the company is hedging the risk itself.

The increase in the number of investable indices in commodities and their associated futures is indicative of the advantages of investing via derivatives. These indices also make investing in commodities available to smaller investors.

## n describe the principal roles suggested for commodities in a portfolio and explain why some commodity classes may provide a better hedge against inflation than others;

Principal roles:
- diversification
- hedge against inflation

2 factors affect hedging inflation:
- storability: Y => good hedge
- demand relative to economic activity

Given the zero-sum nature of futures, the indices cannot use a market-cap method of weighting. 

Two methods of weighting are 
- 1) basing weights on world production of the underlying commodities and
- 2) basing weights on the perceived relative worldwide importance of the commodity. 

The various indices use either arithmetic or geometric averaging to calculate component returns.


## o identify and explain the style classification of a hedge fund, given a description of its investment strategy;

Hedge funds are classified in various ways by different sources. Because hedge funds are a “style-based” asset class, strategies can determine the subgroups. The following is a list of nine of the more familiar hedge fund strategies.
1. Convertible arbitrage commonly involves buying undervalued convertible bonds, preferred stock, or warrants, while shorting the underlying stock to create a hedge.
2. Distressed securities investments can be made in both debt and equity; because the securities are already distressed, shorting can be difficult or impossible.
3. Emerging markets generally only permit long positions, and often there are no derivatives to hedge the investments.
4. Equity market neutral (pairs trading) combines long and short positions in undervalued and over-valued securities, respectively, to eliminate systematic risk while
capitalizing on mispricing.
5. Fixed-income arbitrage involves taking long and short positions in fixed-income instruments based upon expected changes in the yield curve and/or credit spreads.
6. Fund-of-funds describes a hedge fund that invests in many hedge funds to get diversification; there is a fee paid to the manager of the fund-of-funds, as well as
to the managers of the funds in the fund-of-funds.
7. Global macro strategies take positions in major financial and nonfinancial markets through various means (e.g., derivatives and currencies), focusing on an entire
group or area of investment instead of individual securities.
8. Hedged equity strategies (i.e., equity long-short) represent the largest hedge fund classification in terms of assets under management. These strategies take long and
short positions in under- and over-valued securities, respectively. Hedged equity strategies do not focus on balancing the positions to eliminate systematic risk and
can range from net long to net short.
9. Merger arbitrage (i.e., deal arbitrage) focuses on returns from mergers, spin-offs, takeovers, and so on

## p discuss the typical structure of a hedge fund, including the fee structure, and explain the rationale for high-water mark provisions;

The most common compensation structure of a hedge fund consists of an assets-under-management (AUM) fee of about 1% to 2% and an incentive fee of 20% of profits.

High water marks (HWMs) are typically employed to avoid incentive fee double dipping. 
- For example, each quarter the increase in value over the previous quarter is determined, and investors pay incentive and management fees accordingly. 
- If the value of the fund is lower than the previous quarter, however, the manager receives only the management fee, and the previous high value of the fund is established as a HWM.

A lock-up period limits withdrawals by requiring a minimum investment period (e.g., one to three years), preventing sudden withdrawals that could force the manager to have to unwind positions.

Incentive fees are paid to encourage the manager to earn ever higher profits. There is some controversy concerning incentive fees because the manager should have goals other than simply earning a gross return.

## q describe the purpose and characteristics of fund-of-funds hedge funds;

A fund-of-funds (FOF) consists of approximately 10 to 30 hedge funds. The point is to achieve diversification, but the extra layer of management means an extra layer of fees.

Often, an FOF offers more liquidity for the investor, but the cost is cash drag. 

Despite the drawbacks, FOF are good entry-level investments because the manager of the FOF exercises due diligence.

An FOF may serve as a better benchmark because it suffers from less survivorship bias.

An FOF can suffer from **style drift**. Often two FOF that are classified as having the same style have a low correlation of returns.

FOF returns have been more highly correlated with equity markets than those of individual hedge funds. This characteristic has important implications for their use as a diversifier in an equity portfolio (i.e., as correlation increases, diversification decreases)

## r discuss concerns involved in hedge fund performance evaluation;

Conventions to consider in hedge fund performance evaluation are the impact of performance fees and lock-up periods, the age of funds, and the size of funds.
- Funds with longer lock-up periods tend to produce higher returns than those with shorter lock-up periods.
- Younger funds tend to outperform older funds.
- Large funds underperform small funds

- One of the most obvious problems in using the Sharpe ratio is that returns often exhibit skew, making standard deviation (used in the Sharpe ratio) inappropriate.
- Another problem is that the reported risk is often understated, not overstated. Among other things, managers may use calculations that are multiplicative for risk but compounded for return, biasing up the reported return in relation to understating the reported risk.
- Return data is generally based on self-reporting and better managers are more likely to report, which overstates return data of the peer group. 

The Sharpe ratio has the following limitations with respect to hedge fund evaluation:
- Time dependency. Annualized Sharpe ratios are biased upwards by a factor of the square root of time. The ratio can be further overstated by compounding the subperiod returns while using a multiplicative approach to annualize the risk.
- Assumes normality. Measures that incorporate standard deviation are inappropriate for skewed return distributions.
- Assumes liquidity. Illiquid holdings have upward-biased Sharpe ratios (i.e., downward-biased standard deviations).
- Assumes uncorrelated returns. Returns correlated across time will artificially lower the standard deviation.
- Stand-alone measure. Does not automatically consider diversification effects.


Downside deviation is a popular hedge fund risk measure, as it measures only the dispersion of returns below some specified threshold return.

## s describe trading strategies of managed futures programs and the role of managed futures in a portfolio;

- CTAs that specialize in systematic trading strategies typically apply sets of rules to trade according to or contrary to short-, intermediate-, and/or long-term trends.
- A discretionary CTA trading strategy generates returns on the managers’ trading expertise, much like any active portfolio manager. 
- CTAs can also be classified according to whether they trade in financial markets, currency markets, or diversified markets.

- The primary benefit to managed futures is increased risk-adjusted performance and diversification, although the performance seems to be related to specific strategies and time periods. 
- Private funds seem to add value; 
- Publicly traded funds have performed poorly both stand-alone and in portfolios. 
- Even though CTAs often exhibit negative correlations with equities, correlations among CTAs themselves can range from significantly to modestly positive. The CTA β (relative to other CTAs) can be a good indicator of future risk-adjusted performance


## t describe strategies and risks associated with investing in distressed securities;

- Long-only value investing attempts to find opportunities where the prospects will improve tries to find them before other investors do. 
- High-yield investing is buying publicly traded, below-investment grade debt. 
- Orphan equities investing is the purchase of the equities of firms emerging from reorganization.
- Distressed debt arbitrage is the purchasing of a company’s distressed debt while short selling the company’s equity. The investment can earn a return in two ways:
   - If the firm’s condition declines, the debt and equity will both fall in value, but equity should decline more in value.
   - If the company’s prospects improve, the returns to bondholders should be greater than that of equity holders.

Private equity is an “active” approach where the investor acquires positions in the distressed company, and the investment gives some measure of control. The investor can then influence the company as well as acquire more ownership in the process of any reorganization. 

## u explain event risk, market liquidity risk, market risk, and “J factor risk” in relation to investing in distressed securities.

Distressed securities can have several types of risk:
- Event risk refers to the fact that the return on a particular investment within this class typically depends on an event for the particular company. Because these events are usually unrelated to the economy, they can provide diversification benefits.
- Market liquidity risk refers to low liquidity and the fact that there can be cyclical supply and demand for these investments.
- Market risk from macroeconomic changes is usually less important than the first two types mentioned.
- J-factor risk refers to the unpredictable nature of bankruptcy court judges’ rulings.
