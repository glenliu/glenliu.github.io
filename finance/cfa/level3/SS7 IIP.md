# READING 15. MANAGING INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PORTFOLIOS

The candidate should be able to:

## a contrast a defined-benefit plan to a defined-contribution plan and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each from the perspectives of the employee and the employer;

For DB plans, the sponsor promises a future benefit. This creates a pension liability and the sponsor bears the investment risk (i.e., defined future benefits are promised).

For DC plans, the sponsor promises a current contribution and the employees bear the investment risk (i.e., no specific future benefit is promised).

DB plans create early termination risk that the plan will be terminated or the employee will leave before vesting (owning the promised benefit).

For DC plans, the employee generally owns the contribution and subsequent return as soon as they occur. The benefits are generally ***portable***.

DC plans can be 
- sponsor directed where the sponsor makes the investment decision on behalf of the participants or
- participant directed where participants select from among a set of investment alternatives offered by the sponsor.

## b discuss investment objectives and constraints for defined-benefit plans;

The two objectives are:
- Risk.
- Return.

The five constraints are:
- Time horizon.
- Taxes.
- Liquidity.
- Legal and regulatory factors.
- Unique circumstances.

In determining the investment objectives, it is helpful to first determine the plan sponsor’s risk tolerance before the determination of the return objective. 

Pension plans are typically tax exempt.

## c evaluate pension fund risk tolerance when risk is considered from the perspective of the 1) plan surplus, 2) sponsor financial status and profitability, 3) sponsor and pension fund common risk exposures,   4) plan features, and   5) workforce characteristics;

Pension fund risk tolerance is increased (decreased) by:
- Positive (negative) surplus.
- Stronger (weaker) financial status and profitability of the plan sponsor.
- Lower (higher) correlation of plan asset returns and the sponsor’s business.
- Plan features and workforce characteristics that increase (decrease) time horizon and
- lower (increase) liquidity needs.

## d prepare an investment policy statement for a defined-benefit plan;

IPS for Defined-Benefit Plan
- Return: The actuarial discount rate or somewhat higher.
- Risk: Determined by plan and sponsor characteristics. Factors reducing risk tolerance include shorter time horizon, higher liquidity needs, weak sponsor, and positive correlation of sponsor results with plan asset returns.
- Time horizon: Linked to liability duration.
- Taxes: Generally untaxed.
- Legal/regulatory: A prudent expert managing the assets for the benefit of plan participants.
- Liquidity: Linked to needs for plan payouts.
- Unique: Watch for small plans with inadequate resources to complete proper due diligence.

## e evaluate the risk management considerations in investing pension plan assets;

High (positive) correlation of plan asset returns to sponsor operating results reduces risk tolerance because when asset returns are poor and additional contributions may be required, the sponsor is least able to make those contributions and meet the pension liabilities.

ALM is superior to asset only management because it explicitly manages the expected return and volatility of the surplus. It is the size of the surplus that directly affects the future burden of the plan on the sponsor and the sponsor’s ability to meet the pension liabilities.

## f prepare an investment policy statement for a participant directed defined contribution plan;

In a defined-contribution plan, the plan employer does not establish the investment goals and constraints; rather, the employee decides her own risk and return objectives.

Therefore, the employee bears the risk of the investment results. Consequently, the investment policy statement (IPS) for a defined-contribution plan describes the investment alternatives available to the plan participants. This IPS becomes a document of governing principles instead of an IPS for an individual. Some of the issues addressed in the IPS would be:
- Making a distinction between the responsibilities of the plan participants, the fund managers, and the plan sponsor.
- Providing descriptions of the investment alternatives available to the plan participants.
- Providing criteria for monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the investment choices.
- Providing criteria for selection, termination, and replacement of investment choices.
- Establishing effective communication between the fund managers, plan participants, and the plan sponsor.

## g discuss hybrid pension plans (e.g., cash balance plans) and employee stock ownership plans;

A cash balance plan is a defined-benefit plan that defines the benefit in terms of an account balance, which the beneficiary can take as an annuity at retirement or as a lump sum to roll into another plan. In a typical cash balance plan, a participant’s account is credited each year with a pay credit and an interest credit. The pay credit is typically based upon the beneficiary’s age, salary, and/or length of employment, and the interest credit is based upon a benchmark such as U.S. Treasuries. Rather than an actual account with a balance, the cash balance is a paper balance only and represents a future liability for the company.

An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a type of defined-contribution benefit plan that allows employees to purchase the company stock. The purchase can be with before- or after-tax dollars and the final balance in the beneficiary’s account reflects the increase in the value of the firm’s stock as well as contributions during employment.
