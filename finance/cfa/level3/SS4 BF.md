# READING 7. THE BEHAVIORAL FINANCE PERSPECTIVE

The candidate should be able to:
## a contrast traditional and behavioral finance perspectives on investor decisionmaking;


## b contrast expected utility and prospect theories of investment decision making;
Bounded rationality:
  - knowledge capacity limits
  - not assume:
     - perfect info
     - fully rational decisioin making
     - consistent utility maximization
  - practice satisfice

Prospect Theory:
  - relax assumption of risk aversioni, propose loss aversion
  - choices are made in 2 phases:
     - editing phase: 
        - frames proposals
        - establish a reference point
        - simplify number  of choices, address cognitive limitations
     - evaluation phase: loss aversion


## c discuss the effect that cognitive limitations and bounded rationality may have on investment decision making;

## d compare traditional and behavioral finance perspectives on portfolio construction and the behavior of capital markets.

# READING 8. THE BEHAVIORAL BIASES OF INDIVIDUALS

The candidate should be able to:
## a distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases;
 - Cognitive errors: faulty reasoning, lack of understanding, info processing mistakes, memory errors -> Easier to correct or mitigate
 - Emotional errors: feelings, impulses, intuition


## b discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their implications for financial decision making;
## c identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioral biases;

  - Cognitive Errors: Belief Perseverance
    - Conservatism bias.
    - Confirmation bias.
    - Representativeness bias.
    - Control bias.
    - Hindsight bias.
  - Cognitive Errors: Information Processing
    - Anchoring and adjustment.
    - Mental accounting bias.
    - Framing bias.
    - Availability bias.
  - Emotional Biases
    - Loss aversion bias.
    - Overconfidence bias.
    - Self-control bias.
    - Status quo bias.
    - Endowment bias.
    - Regret-aversion bias

## d evaluate how behavioral biases affect investment policy and asset allocation decisions and recommend approaches to mitigate their effects.

- Goals-based investing
 recognizes that individuals are subject to loss aversion and mental accounting. Builds a portfolio in layers, each consisting of assets used to meet individual goals. 
Pyramiding: 
  - bottom layer comprised of assets designated to meet the investor’s most important goals. 
  - Each successive layer consists of increasingly risky assets used to meet less and less important goals.
  - Provides investor with ability to see risk more clearly. Although portfolio probably won’t be efficient, it will tend to be fairly well diversified.

- Behaviorally Modified Asset Allocation
  - Emotional biases are more often adapted to through deviations from the rational asset portfolio allocation.
  - Higher wealth relative to lifestyle needs allows for greater deviations from the rational portfolio.
  - The emotional biases of the lower-wealth individual are treated about the same as the cognitive biases of the wealthier individual.
  - The amount of deviation is also affected by the number of different asset classes in the portfolio.
  - The lower the suggested deviation from the rational portfolio asset allocation, the greater the need to moderate the investor’s behavioral biases.
    - Due to significant standard of living risk, for example, the cognitive biases of the low-wealth investor must be moderated.

MODERATE VS ADAPT TO

# READING 9. BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND INVESTMENT PROCESSES

The candidate should be able to:
## a explain the uses and limitations of classifying investors into personality types;
- Uses of classifying investors into behavioral types include:
  - Portfolios that are closer to the efficient frontier and more closely resemble ones based on traditional finance theory.
  - More trusting and satisfied clients.
  - Clients who are better able to stay on track with their long-term strategic plans.
  - Better overall working relationships between the client and adviser.

- Limitations of classifying investors into behavioral types include:
  - Individuals may display both emotional and cognitive errors at the same time, with either behavior appearing irrational.
  - The same individual may display traits of more than one behavioral investor type at the same time; therefore, the investment adviser should not try to classify the individual into only one behavioral investor type.
  - As investors age, they will most likely go through behavioral changes, usually resulting in decreased risk tolerance, along with becoming more emotional about their investing.
  - Even though two individuals may fall into the same behavioral investor type, each individual would not be treated the same due to their unique circumstances.
  - Individuals tend to act irrationally at different times, seemingly without predictability.



## b discuss how behavioral factors affect adviser–client interactions;

A successful client/adviser relationship can be defined in four areas:

  - The adviser understands the long-term financial goals of the client.
  - The adviser maintains a consistent approach with the client.
  - The adviser invests as the client expects.
  - Both client and adviser benefit from the relationship

## c discuss how behavioral factors influence portfolio construction;

## d explain how behavioral finance can be applied to the process of portfolio construction;

## e discuss how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases;

## f discuss how behavioral factors affect investment committee decision making and recommend techniques for mitigating their effects;

## g describe how behavioral biases of investors can lead to market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance. 

Financial bubbles and crashes are periods of unusual positive or negative returns caused by panic buying and selling, neither of which are based on economic fundamentals. In a bubble, the buying is due to investors believing the price of the asset will continue to go up. 
Another way of defining a bubble or crash is a period of prices for an asset class that is two standard deviations away from the price index’s mean value. 
A crash can also be characterized as a fall in asset prices of 30% or more over a period of several months.
