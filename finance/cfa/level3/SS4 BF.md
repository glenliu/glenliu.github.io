Prospect Theory:
  - relax assumption of risk aversioni, propose loss aversion
  - choices are made in 2 phases:
     - editing phase: 
        - frames proposals
        - establish a reference point
        - simplify number  of choices, address cognitive limitations
     - evaluation phase: loss aversion


## c discuss the effect that cognitive limitations and bounded rationality may have on investment decision making;

## d compare traditional and behavioral finance perspectives on portfolio construction and the behavior of capital markets.

# READING 8. THE BEHAVIORAL BIASES OF INDIVIDUALS

The candidate should be able to:
## a distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases;
 - Cognitive errors: faulty reasoning, lack of understanding, info processing mistakes, memory errors -> Easier to correct or mitigate
 - Emotional errors: feelings, impulses, intuition


## b discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their implications for financial decision making;
## c identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioral biases;

  - Cognitive Errors: Belief Perseverance
    - Conservatism bias.
    - Confirmation bias.
    - Representativeness bias.
    - Control bias.
    - Hindsight bias.
  - Cognitive Errors: Information Processing
    - Anchoring and adjustment.
    - Mental accounting bias.
    - Framing bias.
    - Availability bias.
  - Emotional Biases
    - Loss aversion bias.
    - Overconfidence bias.
    - Self-control bias.
    - Status quo bias.
    - Endowment bias.
    - Regret-aversion bias

d evaluate how behavioral biases affect investment policy and asset allocation decisions and recommend approaches to mitigate their effects.

- Goals-based investing
 recognizes that individuals are subject to loss aversion and mental accounting. Builds a portfolio in layers, each consisting of assets used to meet individual goals. 
Pyramiding: 
  - bottom layer comprised of assets designated to meet the investor’s most important goals. 
  - Each successive layer consists of increasingly risky assets used to meet less and less important goals.
  - Provides investor with ability to see risk more clearly. Although portfolio probably won’t be efficient, it will tend to be fairly well diversified.

- Behaviorally Modified Asset Allocation
  - Emotional biases are more often adapted to through deviations from the rational asset portfolio allocation.
  - Higher wealth relative to lifestyle needs allows for greater deviations from the rational portfolio.
  - The emotional biases of the lower-wealth individual are treated about the same as the cognitive biases of the wealthier individual.
  - The amount of deviation is also affected by the number of different asset classes in the portfolio.
  - The lower the suggested deviation from the rational portfolio asset allocation, the greater the need to moderate the investor’s behavioral biases.
    - Due to significant standard of living risk, for example, the cognitive biases of the low-wealth investor must be moderated.
