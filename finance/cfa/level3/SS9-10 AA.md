### Criticism of MVO

#### Adding constraints:
- fixed asset allocation, eg Human capital
- asset allocation range
- upper limit to address liquidity issues
- relative allocation between asset classes
- liability-relative : require an allocation to hedge the liability

#### resampling
- start with basic MVO
- MCS to generate thousands of random variations of the inputs, resulting in efficient frontier
- resampleed EF is an average of all the simulated EF


#### Issues with individuals

Human capital: 
- consistent wages: model as an inflation-linked bond
- less certain and volatile wages: mix of inflation-linked bonds, equities and corporate bonds
- Constraint: HC not tradable, so percentage is current value

Residential real estate:
- Return and risk estimated using a residential RE property index
- Allocation constraint at current value

#### MCS
Can be used to:
- Address the limitation of single period: consider tax, interim cash flows in multiple period framework. = simulate future return paths over time.
- Guide individuals for risk tolerance level, illustrate range and likelihood of possible outcomes given various assumptions.

#### Less-liquid asset class in MVO

Why difficult:
- few indexes
- Even index exist, they are not investable
- Risk-return characteristics of a specific RE, PE or infrastructure are different to its asset class.

How to address:
- Exclude illiquid asset class
- model the input of the specific investment (risk incl. nonsystematic and systematic)
- Incl the illiquid asset class using highly diversified asset class inputs, using reported AL investment indexes

3. Module 19.2: Reverse Optimization, Black Litterman, Resampling,and Other Approaches
4. Module 19.3: Example
5. Module 19.4: Issues for Individuals
6. Module 19.5: A Risk Budgeting Approach

 $ MCTR_i=\beta_i * \sigma_p $

 $ ACTR_i=\omega_i * MCTR_i $

Optimal:

 $ ExcessReturn_i/MCTR_i= ExcessReturn_j/MCTR_j=SR_p $


### 7. Module 19.6: An ALM Approach

#### Characteristics of liability:
- Fixed vs. contingent
- Legal vs quasi-legal
- Duration and convexity
- Value vs size
- Factors affecting cash flow
- Timing
- Regulator rules

#### 3 approaches for liability relative asset allocation
- Surplus optimization
- Two-portfolio approach (hedging or return-seeking)
- Integrated asset-liability
