expectations in the portfolio management process.

LOS 16.b: Discuss challenges in developing capital market forecasts.

Problems of forecasting
- limitations to using economic data.
  - transcription error
  - survivorship bias
  - appraisal (smoothed) data
- data measurement errors and biases
- limitations of historical returns
  - regime changes and non-stationary
- ex post to determine ex ante
- patterns unlikely to occur
  - data mining
  - time period bias
- fail to account for conditioning information
- misinterpretation of correlation
- psychological traps
  - anchoring
  - status quo
  - confirming evidence
  - overconfidence
  - prudence
  - recallability
- model and input uncertainty





3. Module 16.2: Statistical Tools and Discounted Cash Flow Models

 - Statistical tools

   - historical return
   - geometric average
   - ERP+bond yield
   - shrinkage estimate (weighted average)
   - Time series model: 
      - volatility clustering: sigma^2=beta*sigma^2+(1-beta)eplison^2
   - multifactor model
   - rigorous approach: Level 1 -> Level 2

 - DCF
   - disadvantage: not account for current market condition, suitable for long term valuation
   - GGM
   - G&K model:
      - expected income return: D1/P0-deltaS
      - expected nominal earning growth: i+g
      - repricing return: delta P/E

4. Module 16.3: Risk Premiums, Financial Equilibrium, and Surveys

- Risk premium: R = rf+inflation+default+illiquidity+maturity+tax
- Financial Equilibrium: 
  - ICAPM: Ri=Rf+beta(Rm-Rf) => RPi=Rho*Sigmai*market sharpe ratio
  -  adjust market impeferction (Singer & Terhaar)
    - assuming full integration: ERP=Rho*Sigma*MSR + illiquidity
    - assuming full segmentation: ERP=Sigma*MSR + illiquidity
    - weighted average of the two

- Survey and judgement

  - Survey: constant over time: panel method
  - Judgment 

5. Module 16.4: The Business Cycle

inflection point

cyclical activity:
- GDP: real
- output gap: potential vs current
- recession: decrease over 2 consecutive quarters

inventory cycle: 2-4 years  inventory to sales ratio
business cycle: 9-11 years
 - initial recovery
 - early upswing
 - late upswing
 - slow down
 - recession

Big table for the 5 cycles ==TODO

|Business cycle | Inflation   | Economic policy     |Market - ST       |Market - LT
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
|Initial recovery|Initially declining inflation|Stimulative| Low or declining|bottoming and bond prices peaking|
|Early upswing    | Low inflation and good economic growth|Less stimulative| Increasing | Bottoming or increasing, bond prices begin to decline|
|Late upswing    |Increasing     |Restrictive        |increasing       |increasing, bond prices declining|
|Slowdown       |accelerate      |less restrictive    | peaking then declining      |peaking then declining, bond prices start to increase|
|Recession      |inflation peaking | Easing           |declining      |declining, bond prices increasing, stock prices begin to increase later in recession|


Inflation and asset returns

|Level           |Cash Equivalents |Bonds       | Real Estate   | Equity    |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
|at or below exp |Neutral with stable or declining yield |Neutral with stable or declining yield | Neutral with typical rates of return | Positive with predictable economical growth|
|above exp       |Positive with increasing yields| Negative as rates increase| Positive | Negative|
|Deflation       | Negative (approx 0% interest rate) | Positive (fixed future CF has greater purchase power) | Negative   | Negative  | 

Severe threat of deflation:
- encourage default on debt obligation
- limit the central banks ability to lower interest rate and stimulate the economy. => QE

Consumer spending:
 - seasonal pattern
 - > business spending
 - non-farm payroll + unemployment claims => after tax income => consumer spending
 - savings rate, consumer confidence

Business spending:
 - volatile

6. Module 16.5: Monetary Policy and Interest Rates

Taylor rule: rtarget = rneutral + [0.5(GDPexpected − GDPtrend) + 0.5(iexpected − itarget)]

where:
rtarget = short-term interest rate target
rneutral = neutral short-term interest rate. The rate at which a balance between growth and inflation is achieved
GDP expected = expected GDP growth rate
GDP trend = long-term trend in the GDP growth rate
iexpected = expected inflation rate
itarget = target inflation rate

e.g.  Rtarget = 4% + [0.5(0%-2%)+0.5(7%-3%0] 
              = 4% + (-1%+2%)
              = 5%

In this example, the weak projected economic growth calls for cutting interest rates. If inflation were not a consideration, the target interest rate would be 1% lower than the neutral rate. 
However, the higher projected inflation overrides the growth concern because projected inflation is 4% greater than the target inflation rate. 
In net, the target rate is 5% because the concern over high inflation overrides the weak growth concern.

### Negative interest rate:

Reason: implicit advantage of quick transfer > explicit cost of holding deposits at negative rates

Similar effects as QE (in theory):
- Holders of funds find desirable to spend money
- invest in long term stocks and bonds -> drive up asset prices and create wealth effect
- consumer and business to borrow zero or negative rates to spend now
