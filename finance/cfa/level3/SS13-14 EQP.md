# READING 26. INTRODUCTION TO EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio;

- Capital appreciation
- Divident income
- Diversification
- Inflation hedge

Client investment consideration:
- positive screening
- negative screening
- thematic investment

## b describe how an equity manager’s investment universe can be segmented;

- Size (market capitalization) and style (growth, value, or blended).
- Geographic segmentation (which includes developed markets, emerging markets, and frontier markets).
- Economic activity segmentation by sectors or industries. Classification can be based on a market-oriented or a production-oriented approach.
- Or combinations of the previous can be used.

## c describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance;

Income can be generated from:
- Dividends, mostly in the form of regular dividends received.
- Lending securities for a fee and earning funds on cash collateral received.
  - Pro: fee
  - con/issue:
     -  price down
     -  quality of borrower and ability to return
     -  need borrower to return dividend
     -  lose right to vote
- Writing options for the premium received.
- Dividend capture through buying a stock just before and selling it just after it goes ex-dividend.

Management fee. in or separate.
Other costs to consider are:
- Transaction and trading costs, which may be explicit or implicit.
- Strategy costs—generally active strategies will have higher cost. Passive strategies may incur hidden costs such as predatory pricing when others anticipate and trade ahead of the passive investor.
- Liquidity demands

Equity portfolios also incur fees and costs. These include:
- Management and performance (incentive) fees.
  - incentive: high-watermark
- Administration fees.
- Marketing and distribution fees.
- Trading costs. explicit/implicit (spread, slippage cost)
- Investment strategy costs.
  - active: more investment analysis and transaction
  - passive: predatory trading

## d describe the potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager might play in shareholder engagement;

Shareholder engagement refers to shareholders and managers seeking to influence the companies they invest in through calls and/or shareholder voting. 

Benefits:
- Engagement benefits the company with improved corporate governance. (strategy, capital allocation, compensation, board of directors)
- It may benefit shareholders through higher stock price. 
- Free riders who don’t incur the costs of engagement also benefit.

Cost:
- Active -> do
- Passive -> avoid/minimize
- Larger -> easily absorb

Activist investors take this further and propose resolutions to be voted on and seek the support of others or engage in proxy flights to achieve their goals.

Limitations:
- Focus on short-term goals
- Lead to acquisitioni of MNI
- Potential conflicts of interest

## e describe rationales for equity investment across the passive–active spectrum.

Equity portfolios are often characterized as being actively or passively managed.
However, in practice, portfolios may exhibit characteristics from both investment strategies. 
Rationales for equity portfolios to span across the passive-active spectrum include 
  - manager confidence,
  - client preferences
  - benchmark selection
  - client mandates

active management costs/risks, 
 - reputation risk: results from violations to rules, regulations, client agreements, or moral principles
 - key person risk
 - taxes.

# READING 27. PASSIVE EQUITY INVESTING

The candidate should be able to:

## a discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio;
An equity index used as a benchmark for equity investment strategies must be
- Rules-based: The rules for including and excluding stocks in the portfolio, the weighting scheme, and the rebalancing frequency must be consistent, objective, and predictable so investors can replicate the investment performance of the index.
- Transparent: The rules underlying the index are public, clearly stated and understandable to investors.
- Investable: Investors can replicate the return and risk performance of the index.

Considerations in choosing a benchmark include 
- determining the desired market exposure, 
  -  Market segment
  - Capitalization (size)
  - growth vs value (style)
  - other risk factors: momentum, liq, volatility, quality
- identifying the methods used in constructing and maintaining the index
  - exhaustive or selective
  - weighting method
    - market cap / liq weighting, most common - free float, exclude closely held
    - price: DJIA, equal number of shares
    - equal: reduce concentration risk, small cap bias, volatile, factor-indifferent
    - fundamental

stock concentration: HHI
effective number of stocks '<' actual number, reflects the disproportionate effect of large cap stocks in the index.

Rebalance: +- weight
Reconstitute: add/remove to index


## b compare passive factor-based strategies to market-capitalization-weighted indexing;
Passive strategy can be achieved by either:
- market-capitalization-weighted investment strategy 
- passive factor-based strategy (also known as smart beta). Goal: improve on the risk/return performance by offseting higher cost
   - growth factor
   - value factor
   - size factor
   - yield factor
   - momentum factor
   - quality factor
   - volatility factor

Three types of passive factor-based strategies
- Return oriented: dividend yield, momentum and fundamentallyweighted strategies
- Risk oriented: volatility and min-variance investing
- Diversification oriented

Passive factor-based strategies often use multiple benchmarks, including both factor based and market-cap-weighted indexes. This increases tracking error.
 - The advantages of passive factor-based investing include that it is typically less costly than active management, but still offers the investor factor exposure based on the investor’s view of the market (which is known as factor rotation).
 - The disadvantages include that, relative to passive cap-weighted investing, management fees and trading commissions are higher

## c compare different approaches to passive equity investing;
- Pooled investments:
  - adv: open-end mutual funds -> low costs, convenience of fund structure
  - adv: ETF can handle redemptions more cheaply and efficiently through in-kind delivery of stock. Reduce taxable G/L.
  - disadv: ETF -> higher transaction costs from commissions and bid-ask spread, illiquidity
- Derivative based strategy to recreate risk/return performance of an index.
  - overlay positions (completiion overlays, rebalancing overlays, currency overlays) to adjust existing portofolio risk/return exposure
  - adv: quickly, efficiently, cheaply; liquid; easy to leverage;
  - disadv: finite expiration need to roll over; position limits; specialty needs not met; OTC - conterparty risk; basis risk increase tracking error
- Separately managed. Hold all or a representative sample.

## d compare the full replication, stratified sampling, and optimization approaches for the construction of passively managed equity portfolios;

- full replication: costly
- stratified sampling: strata formed across multiple dimensions, size up -> less tracking error
- optimization: MPT minimize tracking error. drawback: based on historical relationship; not mean-variance efficient (solution: constraint on total portfolio variance to be volatility of benchmark)
- blended:
  - full replication for index will small number of liquid stocks
  - stratified sampling or optimization for index with lots of heterogeneous, thinly traded stocks

Adding to the sample size with liquid stocks first reduces tracking error; but as less liquid stocks are added, the costs and tracking error increase

## e discuss potential causes of tracking error and methods to control tracking error for passively managed equity portfolios;

Tracking error initially declines as sample size increases but then increases as costs (transaction, management, and illiquidity) increase.
 Intra-day trading and cash drag also create tracking error.
Reducing tracking error requires a continuing evaluation of the tradeoff between the benefits of larger sample size and increasing costs. Derivatives can be used to minimize the effects of cash drag

## f explain sources of return and risk to a passively managed equity portfolio.

Attribution analysis is a key tool in helping the manager identify the sources of tracking error.
Securities lending can generate fee income to offset some of the costs of managing the portfolio and reduce tracking error.
Corporate governance and investor activism is important for both passive and active investors.

# READING 28. ACTIVE EQUITY INVESTING: STRATEGIES

The candidate should be able to:

## a compare fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management;


Managers can use a blend of bottom-up and top-down approaches. For example, 
- a topdown strategist sets target country or sector weights, and then bottom-up portfolio managers select the best investments consistent with these weights. 
- Or the bottom-up managers could drive the portfolio construction process through selecting the best individual investments, with a top-down-based derivatives overlay added to remove unintended macro exposures.

## b analyze bottom-up active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes;
Bottom-up strategies analyze information at the company level to generate investment ideas.
 Bottom up strategies can be divided into value and growth styles.
 Value substyles include relative value, contrarian, high-quality value, income investing, deep value, restructuring and distressed debt, and special situations.

- Quantitative bottom-up managers look for quantifiable relationships between company level information (e.g., P/E ratio) and expected return that will persist into the future.
- Fundamental bottom-up managers incorporate both quantifiable and qualitative characteristics of individual companies into their analysis (e.g., business model and branding, competitive advantage, and quality of company management and corporate governance).

## c analyze top-down active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes;
Top-down managers typically use broad market ETFs and derivatives to overweight the best markets and underweight the least attractive markets 

Top-down strategies focus on the macroeconomic environment, demographic trends, and government policies to make investment decisions. 
Top-down strategies could focus on geography, industry, equity style rotation, volatility-based strategies, or thematic investment ideas.

The proliferation over recent years of structured products and focused ETFs has provided managers with greater flexibility in implementing passive factor investing (sometimes referred to as ‘smart beta’ products), allowing the manager to target a specific style or sector at a time when they believe it will outperform.

## d analyze factor-based active strategies, including their rationale and associated processes;
Quantitative strategies often use factor-based models, which aim to identify factors that drive performance historically and are likely to continue to do so in the future. 
- rewarded
- unrewarded

Identify factors performance - Hedged Portfolio Approach
1. rank by factor
2. divide into quantiles
3. form a long/short portfolio: long best 10% short worst 10%
4. track performance

Drawbacks of HPA:
1. ignore middle quantiles
2. assume linear factor vs return relationship
3. if factors are correlated, then less diversification
4. assume can short
5. not "pure" factor, will have exposure to other risk factors

Factors can be based on fundamental characteristics such as value and growth, and price momentum, or on unconventional data.

Equity style rotation

## e analyze activist strategies, including their rationale and associated processes;
Activist investors specialize in taking meaningful stakes in listed companies and then publicly pushing for changes to the management, strategy, or capital structure of the company that they believe will enhance value

Process

Target companies

Popularity

Impact

## f describe active strategies based on statistical arbitrage and market microstructure;

Stat arb funds look to profit from anomalies in technical market data (i.e.,prices and volumes), for example,
- pairs trading
- market microstructure: HFT to capture misplace in a milliseconds.


Event-driven strategies (risk arb) exploit market inefficiencies that may occur around mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, bankruptcies, share buybacks, special dividends, and spin-offs

## g describe how fundamental active investment strategies are created;

The fundamental active investment process consists of the following steps:
1. Define the investment universe in accordance with the fund mandate.
  - Define the market opportunity (investment thesis) and explain why it is there.
2. Prescreen the investment universe to obtain a manageable set of securities for detailed analysis.
  - For example, a value manager might screen to remove stocks with high P/E multiples.
3. Analyze the industry, competitive position, and financial reports of the companies.
4. Forecast performance, most commonly based on cash flows or earnings.
5. Convert forecasts to valuations.
6. Construct a portfolio of profitable investments with the desired risk profile.
  - Incorporate any top-down view on sectors/markets at this stage.
7. Rebalance the portfolio with buy and sell disciplines.

Pitfalls in fundamental investing include
 - behavioral biases: confirmation bias, illusion of control, availability bias, loss aversion, overconfidence, and regret aversion.
 - the value trap, where a stock that appears to be attractive because of a significant price fall, may in fact be overvalued and decline further. 
 - the growth trap. favorable future growth prospects are already reflected, or over-reflected, in the price. 

## h describe how quantitative active investment strategies are created;
The quantitative active investment process includes the following steps:
 1. Define the market opportunity.
 2. Acquire and process data.
 3. Back-test the strategy.
   - 1. obtain sample of historical data
   - 1. calc E/Y and subsequent performance
   - 1. rank stocks by E/P: factor score = (actual E/P - avg E/P) / Sigma E/P 
   - 1. Calc IC (information coefficent), Spearman, Pearson
   - 1. The Pearson IC of the raw data is sensitive to even a few outliers (extreme high or low historical return). The Spearman Rank IC addressees this issue and is often considered more robust (superior).


 4. Evaluate the strategy. out of sample testing, VaR and max drawdown
 5. Portfolio construction. consider risk models (rely on commercial risk models), trading costs

Pitfalls in quantitative investing include
- look-ahead 
- survivorship biases, 
- overfitting / data mining,
- unrealistic turnover assumptions,
- transaction costs
- short availability.


## i discuss equity investment style classifications.
The two main approaches used in style analysis are holdings-based and returns-based.
- Holdings-based approaches aggregate the style scores of individual holdings, 
- returns-based approaches analyze the investment style of portfolio managers by regressing historical portfolio returns against a set of style indexes.
