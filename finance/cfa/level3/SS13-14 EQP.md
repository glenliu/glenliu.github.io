# READING 26. INTRODUCTION TO EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio;

- Capital appreciation
- Divident income
- Diversification
- Inflation hedge

Client investment consideration:
- positive screening
- negative screening
- thematic investment

## b describe how an equity manager’s investment universe can be segmented;

- Size (market capitalization) and style (growth, value, or blended).
- Geographic segmentation (which includes developed markets, emerging markets, and frontier markets).
- Economic activity segmentation by sectors or industries. Classification can be based on a market-oriented or a production-oriented approach.
- Or combinations of the previous can be used.

## c describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance;

Income can be generated from:
- Dividends, mostly in the form of regular dividends received.
- Lending securities for a fee and earning funds on cash collateral received.
  - Pro: fee
  - con/issue:
     -  price down
     -  quality of borrower and ability to return
     -  need borrower to return dividend
     -  lose right to vote
- Writing options for the premium received.
- Dividend capture through buying a stock just before and selling it just after it goes ex-dividend.

Management fee. in or separate.
Other costs to consider are:
- Transaction and trading costs, which may be explicit or implicit.
- Strategy costs—generally active strategies will have higher cost. Passive strategies may incur hidden costs such as predatory pricing when others anticipate and trade ahead of the passive investor.
- Liquidity demands

Equity portfolios also incur fees and costs. These include:
- Management and performance (incentive) fees.
  - incentive: high-watermark
- Administration fees.
- Marketing and distribution fees.
- Trading costs. explicit/implicit (spread, slippage cost)
- Investment strategy costs.
  - active: more investment analysis and transaction
  - passive: predatory trading

## d describe the potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager might play in shareholder engagement;

Shareholder engagement refers to shareholders and managers seeking to influence the companies they invest in through calls and/or shareholder voting. 

Benefits:
- Engagement benefits the company with improved corporate governance. (strategy, capital allocation, compensation, board of directors)
- It may benefit shareholders through higher stock price. 
- Free riders who don’t incur the costs of engagement also benefit.

Cost:
- Active -> do
- Passive -> avoid/minimize
- Larger -> easily absorb

Activist investors take this further and propose resolutions to be voted on and seek the support of others or engage in proxy flights to achieve their goals.

Limitations:
- Focus on short-term goals
- Lead to acquisitioni of MNI
- Potential conflicts of interest

## e describe rationales for equity investment across the passive–active spectrum.

Equity portfolios are often characterized as being actively or passively managed.
However, in practice, portfolios may exhibit characteristics from both investment strategies. 
Rationales for equity portfolios to span across the passive-active spectrum include 
  - manager confidence,
  - client preferences
  - benchmark selection
  - client mandates

active management costs/risks, 
 - reputation risk: results from violations to rules, regulations, client agreements, or moral principles
 - key person risk
 - taxes.

# READING 27. PASSIVE EQUITY INVESTING

The candidate should be able to:

## a discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio;
An equity index used as a benchmark for equity investment strategies must be
- Rules-based: The rules for including and excluding stocks in the portfolio, the weighting scheme, and the rebalancing frequency must be consistent, objective, and predictable so investors can replicate the investment performance of the index.
- Transparent: The rules underlying the index are public, clearly stated and understandable to investors.
- Investable: Investors can replicate the return and risk performance of the index.

Considerations in choosing a benchmark include 
- determining the desired market exposure, 
  -  Market segment
  - Capitalization (size)
  - growth vs value (style)
  - other risk factors: momentum, liq, volatility, quality
- identifying the methods used in constructing and maintaining the index
  - exhaustive or selective
  - weighting method
    - market cap / liq weighting, most common - free float, exclude closely held
    - price: DJIA, equal number of shares
    - equal: reduce concentration risk, small cap bias, volatile, factor-indifferent
    - fundamental

stock concentration: HHI
effective number of stocks '<' actual number, reflects the disproportionate effect of large cap stocks in the index.

Rebalance: +- weight
Reconstitute: add/remove to index


## b compare passive factor-based strategies to market-capitalization-weighted indexing;
Passive strategy can be achieved by either:
- market-capitalization-weighted investment strategy 
- passive factor-based strategy (also known as smart beta). Goal: improve on the risk/return performance by offseting higher cost
   - growth factor
   - value factor
   - size factor
   - yield factor
   - momentum factor
   - quality factor
   - volatility factor

Three types of passive factor-based strategies
- Return oriented: dividend yield, momentum and fundamentallyweighted strategies
- Risk oriented: volatility and min-variance investing
- Diversification oriented

Passive factor-based strategies often use multiple benchmarks, including both factor based and market-cap-weighted indexes. This increases tracking error.
 - The advantages of passive factor-based investing include that it is typically less costly than active management, but still offers the investor factor exposure based on the investor’s view of the market (which is known as factor rotation).
 - The disadvantagesinclude that, relative to passive cap-weighted investing, management fees and trading commissions are higher

## c compare different approaches to passive equity investing;
- Pooled investments:
  - adv: open-end mutual funds -> low costs, convenience of fund structure
  - adv: ETF can handle redemptions more cheaply and efficiently through in-kind delivery of stock. Reduce taxable G/L.
  - disadv: ETF -> higher transaction costs from commissions and bid-ask spread, illiquidity
- Derivative based strategy to recreate risk/return performance of an index.
  - overlay positions (completiion overlays, rebalancing overlays, currency overlays) to adjust existing portofolio risk/return exposure
  - adv: quickly, efficiently, cheaply; liquid; easy to leverage;
  - disadv: finite expiration need to roll over; position limits; specialty needs not met; OTC - conterparty risk; basis risk increase tracking error
- Separately managed. Hold all or a representative sample.

## d compare the full replication, stratified sampling, and optimization approaches for the construction of passively managed equity portfolios;

- full replication: costly
- stratified sampling: strata formed across multiple dimensions, size up -> less tracking error
- optimization: MPT minimize tracking error. drawback: based on historical relationship; not mean-variance efficient (solution: constraint on total portofolio variance to be volatility of benchmark)
- blended:
  - full replicatin for index will small number of liquid stocks
  - stratified sampling or optimization for index with lots of heterogeneous, thinly traded stocks

Adding to the sample size with liquid stocks first reduces tracking error; but as less liquid stocks are added, the costs and tracking error increase

## e discuss potential causes of tracking error and methods to control tracking error for passively managed equity portfolios;

## f explain sources of return and risk to a passively managed equity portfolio.

b discuss approaches for constructing actively managed equity portfolios;

c distinguish between Active Share and active risk and discuss how each measure relates to a manager’s investment strategy;

d discuss the application of risk budgeting concepts in portfolio construction;
