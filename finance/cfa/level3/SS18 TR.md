# READING 35. EXECUTION OF PORTFOLIO DECISIONS

The candidate should be able to:

## a compare market orders with limit orders, including the price and execution uncertainty of each;

## b calculate and interpret the effective spread of a market order and contrast it to the quoted bid–ask spread as a measure of trading cost;

## c compare alternative market structures and their relative advantages;
- Quote-driven: dealer markets dealer=market maker
 - Many markets that trade illiquid securities (e.g., bond markets) are organized as dealer markets 
 - Dealers also provide liquidity for securities whose terms are negotiated
 - the dealer that offers the best price is not always the one to get a trader’s business because of credit risk

- Order-driven
 - electronic crossing networks
   - the typical trader is an institution. 
   - Orders are batched together and crossed (matched) at fixed points in time during the day at the average of the bid and ask quotes.
   - The costs of trading are low because commissions are low and traders do not pay a dealer’s bid-ask spread. 
   - A trade may not be filled or may be only partially filled if there is insufficient trading activity.
   - The trader usually does not know the identity of the counterparty or the counterparty’s trade size in an electronic crossing network. 
   - no price discovery
 - auction
   - periodic/batch, or continous auction
   - price discovery
 - automated auctions (electronic limit-order markets)
   - identity not known
   - price discovery 
- Brokered market
  - A broker can place the order without revealing his client’s identity. 
  - He can discreetly shop the stock and find the necessary liquidity.
  - He may even take a position in the stock with his own capital.
  - important in countries where public capital markets are not well developed
- hybrid market

## d explain the criteria of market quality and evaluate the quality of a market when given a description of its characteristics;
 - liquidity
   - If a market has small spreads, traders are apt to trade more often. 
   - Market depth allows larger orders to trade without affecting security prices much.
   - A market is resilient if asset prices stay close to their intrinsic values, and any deviations from intrinsic value are minimized quickly
   
   - An abundance of buyers and sellers, so traders know they can quickly reverse their trade if necessary.
   - Investor characteristics are diverse. If every investor had the same information, valuations, and liquidity needs, there would be little trading.
   - A convenient location or trading platform which lends itself to increased investor activity and liquidity.
   - Integrity as reflected in its participants and regulation, so that all investors receive fair treatment.
 - transparency
   -  investors can, without significant expense or delay, obtain both pre-trade information (regarding quotes and spreads) and post-trade information(regarding completed trades)
 - assurity of completion
   - nvestors can be confident that the counterparty will uphold its side of the trade agreement.
 
 evaluate the quality of a market
 - transparency and assurity of completion require a qualitative assessment
 - liquidity can be measured by the quoted spread, effective spread, and ask and bid sizes. 
 
## e explain the components of execution costs, including explicit and implicit costs, and evaluate a trade in terms of these costs;

The explicit costs of trade execution are directly observable and include 
- commissions,
- taxes, 
- stamp duties, 
- fees. 
Implicit costs are harder to measure, but they are real. They include 
- the bid-ask spread,
- market or price impact costs,
- opportunity costs, and
- delay costs (i.e., slippage costs).
 They must be inferred by measuring the results of the trade versus a reference point.
 
 Volume weighted average price shortcomings:
  1. not useful if trader is significant part of the volume
  2. "game" the comparison. wait until later to decide which trade to execute
  3. not consider missed trades
  

## f calculate and discuss implementation shortfall as a measure of transaction costs;

## g contrast volume weighted average price (VWAP) and implementation shortfall as measures of transaction costs;

## h explain the use of econometric methods in pretrade analysis to estimate implicit transaction costs;

## i discuss the major types of traders, based on their motivation to trade, time versus price preferences, and preferred order types;

## j describe the suitable uses of major trading tactics, evaluate their relative costs, advantages, and weaknesses, and recommend a trading tactic when given a description of the investor’s motivation to trade, the size of the trade, and key market characteristics;

## k explain the motivation for algorithmic trading and discuss the basic classes of algorithmic trading strategies;

## l discuss the factors that typically determine the selection of a specific algorithmic trading strategy, including order size, average daily trading volume, bid–ask spread, and the urgency of the order;

## m explain the meaning and criteria of best execution;

## n evaluate a firm’s investment and trading procedures, including processes, disclosures, and record keeping, with respect to best execution;

## o discuss the role of ethics in trading.
