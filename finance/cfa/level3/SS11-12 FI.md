# READING 24. YIELD CURVE STRATEGIES

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe major types of yield curve strategies;


Active Strategies When the (Upward Sloping) Yield Curve Is Expected to Be Stable
- Buy and hold — extend duration to get higher yields.
- Roll down the yield curve — portfolio weighting highest for securities at the long end of the steepest yield curve segments, maximizes price gains on securities from declines in yield as time passes.
- Carry trade — borrow at lower rates to purchase securities with higher rates.
- Sell convexity — reduce portfolio convexity to increase yield.

Active Strategies for Anticipated Changes in Yield Curve Level, Slope, or Curvature
- Duration management — increase (decrease) portfolio duration if rates are expected to decrease (increase).
- For nonparallel shifts in the curve — increase (decrease) portfolio exposure to key rate durations where relative decreases (increases) in key rates are expected.
- Buy convexity — increase portfolio convexity; decreases yield but improves price performance for larger changes in rates.
- Bullet and barbell structures — security durations are concentrated around portfolio duration (bullet) or concentrated at the ends of the yield curve (barbell). Barbells tend to have higher convexity but lower yield and tend to outperform if curvature increases.

==============Example===========================
Consider a portfolio with a benchmark that is laddered and has a duration of 10. The manager is considering three possible strategies:
1. Ladder: Match the benchmark which has an equal distribution of 1 to 19 duration bonds for portfolio duration of 10. The yield and convexity are 4.39% and 20.1 respectively.
2. Barbell: 50% in securities with a duration of 2 and 50% in securities with a duration of 18, for portfolio duration of 10. The yield and convexity are 4.30% and 24.7 respectively.
3. Bullet: 100% in securities with a duration of 10. The yield and convexity are 4.51% and 16.4 respectively.

A. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects a small and very near term parallel upward shift in the yield curve.
B. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects a large parallel and very near term upward shift in the yield curve.
C. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects a large parallel downward shift in the yield curve over the next 12 months.
D. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects an immediate steepening of the curve with short rates (duration of 1) decreasing 50 bp, no change in intermediate rates (duration of 10), and long rates (duration of 19) increasing 50 bp.
E. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects an immediate steepening of the curve with short rates (duration of 1) decreasing 10 bp, intermediate rates (duration of 10) increasing 40 bp, and long rates (duration of 19) increasing 90 bp.
F. State and justify the optimal strategy if the manager expects an immediate flattening of the curve with short rates increasing 50 bp, no change in intermediate rates, and long rates decreasing 50 bp.

Answers:
A. There is no distinct advantage for any strategy. They all have the same duration and expected change in value for a parallel shift. The bullet has a yield advantage, but over a short time period
that will not matter much. The barbell has more convexity but for a small change in rates that will not matter much. The ladder more closely matches the portfolio benchmark’s duration distribution
but has no material expected return advantage in this scenario.

B. The barbell. With a large increase in interest rates, the higher convexity of the barbell will produce the greatest cushioning of price decline.

C. There is no distinct advantage for any strategy. There are conflicting issues. They all have the same duration. The bullet has a yield advantage over the next 12 months. The barbell has more convexity which will increase its value gain for a large decrease in rates. The ladder more closely matches the portfolio benchmark’s duration distribution but has no material expected return advantage in this scenario.

D. The bullet is best. With no change in intermediate rates, it will not decline in value. The others will decline in price. The manager has described a pivot in the curve. With long rates up 50 bp and
high duration there will be a large decline in value. The 50 bp decrease in shorter rates with less duration will not produce as large a value gain. Thus the barbell will decline the most and the
ladder will decline some.

E. The bullet is best for the same reasons it is best in part D. There is a steepening and that favors the bullet. There are also elements of a parallel upward shift, but all strategies have the same
duration and respond the same to a parallel shift, ignoring the small convexity effect.

F. The barbell because it has the most exposure to long duration assets where rates will decrease. This will give it the largest value gain.

## b explain how to execute a carry trade;

## c explain why and how a fixed-income portfolio manager might choose to alter portfolio convexity;

## d formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view;


Question: A manager calculates the implied forward rate to exist in one year for today’s 5-year bond to be 4.75%. That same 5-year bond yields 4.85% today and the 1-year bond today yields 3.5%. The manager’s opinion is that interest rates will increase and that in one year, 4-year bonds will yield 5.0%. Assume for simplicity all the bonds and interest rates are zero coupon, estimate the return that will be earned on the 5-year bond over the next year if the manager is correct.
A. 2.50%.
B. 4.00%.
C. 4.75%.

Answer: A. If implied forward rates occur, all bonds will earn the same return over the forward period being analyzed. In this case, that period is one year, so the return will equal the return of today’s one year bond (i.e., 3.5%). The manager projects the yield of today’s 5-year bond when it is a 4-year bond will be 5% and not the implied forward rate of 4.75. This 25 bp higher rate will reduce the bond’s return. It will then have a duration of approximately 4, so the return reduction is 25 × 4 =100 bp. That makes the projected return approximately 3.5 – 1.0 = 2.5%.

  1. Interest income
  2. Price return -current yield curve
  3. Price return - forecasted yield curve
  4. FX changes
  5. Credit rating changes

# READING 25. FIXED-INCOME ACTIVE MANAGEMENT: CREDIT STRATEGIES

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe risk considerations in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond portfolios;

Modified duration - interest rate sensitivity
Spread duration - spread sensitivity

For most bonds, MD and Ds are the same, except floating rate securities:
Given MD=0.25, Ds=9.1:
  - Rf up 20bp: P down 0.05%;
  - Spread up 20bp, P down 1.82%

Negative correlation between Rf and credit spread: 
Weak economy -> Rf down
             -> Prob of Default up -> Spread up

Effective Duration
Empirical Duration: regression of actual price and interest rate change

IG: more sensitive to IR risk
HY: more sensitive to Credit risk
but no absolute, in all cases

 ## b compare the use of credit spread measures in portfolio construction;

- Nominal spread, added to single YTMs:
  - G-spread: straight line interpolation of two closest maturity. can be used to hedge IR risk.
  - I-spread: SFR (more maturities / smoother YC, but not risk free). not used to hedge IR risk.

- Embedded options spread, added to on-the-spot rate curve:
  - Z-spread: Zero (IR) volatility spread. Trial and error add to spot rate (credit risk free). Not consider embedded option
  - OAS: assume IR volatility -> IR tree of possible forward rate -> future cash flow -> single spread trial and error. Expected average incremental return, simulated average result

Z-spread= Credit Risk + Liq Risk + Option Risk
OAS= Credit Risk + Liq Risk

Option-free: Z=OAS
Putable: Z < OAS
Callable: Z > OAS


EXR= s*t - ds*SD - t*PD*EL

Portfolio OAS = Sum (wi * OASi)
