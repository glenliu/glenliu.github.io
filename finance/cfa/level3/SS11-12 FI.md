e explain risks associated with managing a portfolio against a liability structure;

f discuss bond indexes and the challenges of managing a fixed-income portfolio to mimic the characteristics of a bond index;

g compare alternative methods for establishing bond market exposure passively;

h discuss criteria for selecting a benchmark and justify the selection of a benchmark;

i describe construction, benefits, limitations, and risk–return characteristics of a laddered bond portfolio.


# READING 24. YIELD CURVE STRATEGIES

The candidate should be able to:

a describe major types of yield curve strategies;

b explain how to execute a carry trade;

c explain why and how a fixed-income portfolio manager might choose to alter portfolio convexity;

d formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view;


Question: A manager calculates the implied forward rate to exist in one year for today’s 5-year bond to be 4.75%. That same 5-year bond yields 4.85% today and the 1-year bond today yields 3.5%. The manager’s opinion is that interest rates will increase and that in one year, 4-year bonds will yield 5.0%. Assume for simplicity all the bonds and interest rates are zero coupon, estimate the return that will be earned on the 5-year bond over the next year if the manager is correct.
A. 2.50%.
B. 4.00%.
C. 4.75%.

Answer: A. If implied forward rates occur, all bonds will earn the same return over the forward period being analyzed. In this case, that period is one year, so the return will equal the return of today’s one year bond (i.e., 3.5%). The manager projects the yield of today’s 5-year bond when it is a 4-year bond will be 5% and not the implied forward rate of 4.75. This 25 bp higher rate will reduce the bond’s return. It will then have a duration of approximately 4, so the return reduction is 25 × 4 =100 bp. That makes the projected return approximately 3.5 – 1.0 = 2.5%. 

e explain how derivatives may be used to implement yield curve strategies;

f evaluate a portfolio’s sensitivity to a change in curve slope using key rate durations of the portfolio and its benchmark;

g discuss inter-market curve strategies;

h construct a duration-neutral government bond portfolio to profit from a change in yield curve curvature;

i evaluate the expected return and risks of a yield curve strategy.

5 sources:
  1. Interest income
  2. Price return -current yield curve
  3. Price return - forecasted yield curve
  4. FX changes
  5. Credit rating changes

# READING 25. FIXED-INCOME ACTIVE MANAGEMENT: CREDIT STRATEGIES

The candidate should be able to:

## a describe risk considerations in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond portfolios;

Modified duration - interest rate sensitivity
Spread duration - spread sensitivity

For most bonds, MD and Ds are the same, except floating rate securities:
Given MD=0.25, Ds=9.1:
  - Rf up 20bp: P down 0.05%;
  - Spread up 20bp, P down 1.82%

Negative correlation between Rf and credit spread: 
Weak economy -> Rf down
             -> Prob of Default up -> Spread up

Effective Duration
Empirical Duration: regression of actual price and interest rate change

IG: more sensitive to IR risk
HY: more sensitive to Credit risk
but no absolute, in all cases

 ## b compare the use of credit spread measures in portfolio construction;

- Nominal spread, added to single YTMs:
  - G-spread: straight line interpolation of two closest maturity. can be used to hedge IR risk.
  - I-spread: SFR (more maturities / smoother YC, but not risk free). not used to hedge IR risk.

- Embedded options spread, added to on-the-spot rate curve:
  - Z-spread: Zero (IR) volatility spread. Trial and error add to spot rate (credit risk free). Not consider embedded option
  - OAS: assume IR volatility -> IR tree of possible forward rate -> future cash flow -> single spread trial and error. Expected average incremental return, simulated average result

Z-spread= Credit Risk + Liq Risk + Option Risk
OAS= Credit Risk + Liq Risk

Option-free: Z=OAS
Putable: Z < OAS
Callable: Z > OAS


EXR= s*t - ds*SD - t*PD*EL

Portfolio OAS = Sum (wi * OASi)

c discuss bottom-up approaches to credit strategies;

d discuss top-down approaches to credit strategies;

e discuss liquidity risk in credit markets and how liquidity risk can be managed in a credit portfolio;

f describe how to assess and manage tail risk in credit portfolios;

g discuss considerations in constructing and managing portfolios across international credit markets;

h describe the use of structured financial instruments as an alternative to corporate bonds in credit portfolios.
