# READING 10. MANAGING INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR PORTFOLIOS

The candidate should be able to:

## a discuss how source of wealth, measure of wealth, and stage of life affect an individual investors’ risk tolerance;

-Source of Wealth：财富的来源
- Entrepreneurial activity：企业家的活动所带来的财富，属于 active，相对承担风险的能力更强
-  Inheritance（继承）
  - one-time windfalls（意外之财）
  - built up over long periods of safe employment （工资），属于 passive，相对承担风险的能力更弱
  
备注：区分 active 和 passive，主要看自有资金是否承担风险，有风险就是 active，没有风险就是 passive

- Measure of wealth：财富的衡量

 Positive correlation between level of risk tolerance & client’s perception of wealth：风险承受能力与客户财富的感知（收益率）是正相关

备注：return 的目标越大，则 asset base 越小，降低了家庭承受风险的能力（Return 的目标在 10%以上，则asset base 越小）

- Stage of life：生命阶段
 - Foundation phase：基础阶段
 - Accumulation phase：积累阶段
 - Maintenance phase (retirement)：维护阶段（退休）
 - Distribution phase：分发阶段（遗产分配）


Situational profiling is a first step at determining investor attitudes toward risk.
Describe a situational profile according to:

i. Source of wealth.

Information related to source of wealth describes how an investor accumulated wealth.
- At one end of the spectrum is wealth acquired through active means (e.g.,entrepreneurial activities). This indicates knowledge and experience with risktaking activities. 
- The other end of the spectrum is wealth acquired through passive means (e.g., inheritance or long-term employment in a stable corporation). The latter may indicate an investor with less knowledge and experience of risk-taking activities.


ii. Measure of wealth.

The key to understanding measures of wealth relates to how an investor perceives his level of wealth. The perception of wealth may be in relation to funds required to sustain lifestyle activities. 
- If a portfolio is perceived as small, risk tolerance may be low. 
- If a portfolio is perceived as large, risk tolerance may be high.

iii. Stage of life.

Stage of life descriptions indicate where an investor is in relation to the life cycle. Life expectancy is a large factor in connecting stage of life to risk tolerance.
- Due to a long time horizon, young investors often have a high tolerance for risk.
- Older investors, however, may have a diminished risk tolerance.

## b explain the role of situational and psychological profiling in understanding an individual investor’s attitude toward risk;

Situational profiling places individuals into categories according to stage of life or economic circumstances. Situational profiling is only a first step in understanding an individual’s preferences, economic situation, goals, and desires. The starting points for situational profiling include investigating an investor’s sources of wealth, measures of wealth, and stage of life.


According to principles of the behavioral finance investment framework, loss aversion would most likely lead an investor to：

Loss aversion means investors prefer uncertain losses to smaller certain losses. Rather than give up and take a small loss, investors would rather take their chances with a larger loss, as long as there is still the possibility of a gain. These investors will tend to hold losing investments too long

Pyramiding is the concept applied to investor portfolio formation in which portfolios are created by matching layers of assets to specific goals. Each layer of assets is not particularly evaluated within an overall portfolio context. 

## c explain the influence of investor psychology on risk tolerance and investment choices;

- Cautious investors
  - are risk averse 
  - base decisions on feelings.
  - not like making their own investment decisions
  - but are difficult to advise and will sometimes even avoid professional help.
  -  their portfolios exhibit low turnover. 
  
- Methodical investors 
 - risk averse 
 - base decisions on thinking.
 - base decisions on facts,  gather lots of data
 - conservative
 - look for more information.
 
- Individualistic investors 
 - less risk averse 
 - base decisions on thinking
 - do their own research 
 - are very confident in their ability to make investment decisions
 
- Spontaneous investors 
 - less risk averse 
 - base decisions on feelings
 - constantly adjust their portfolios， high turnover.
 - acknowledge their lack of investment expertise but at the same time tend to doubt investment advice.
 - chase fads, and continually want to do something

## d explain potential benefits, for both clients and investment advisers, of having a formal investment policy statement;

For the client, the benefits of the IPS include:

- The IPS identifies and documents investment ***objectives and constraints***.
- The IPS is dynamic, allowing ***changes in objectives and/or constraints (O&C)*** in response to changing client circumstances or capital market conditions.
- The IPS is easily understood, providing the client with the ability to bring in ***new managers or change managers*** without disruption of the investment process.
- Developing the IPS should be an ***educational experience*** for the client.
  - Clients learn more about ***themselves and investment decision making***.
  - They are better able to ***understand the manager’s investment recommendations***.
  
For the adviser, the benefits include:
- Greater ***knowledge of the client***.
- Guidance for investment ***decision making***.
- Guidance for ***resolution of disputes***.
  - Signed documentation that can be used to ***support*** the manager’s investment decisions as well as the manager’s ***denials*** of client investment requests.

## e explain the process involved in creating an investment policy statement;

- Determine and evaluate the investor’s risk and return objectives. Planning return expectations should take place concurrently with risk tolerance discussions.
- Determine portfolio constraints.
- Define the appropriate investment strategy based upon an analysis of objectives, constraints, and market expectations.
- Determine the proper asset allocation to meet the investor’s objectives and constraints. An SAA is sometimes included

## f distinguish between required return and desired return and explain how these affect the individual investor’s investment policy;

## g explain how to set risk and return objectives for individual investor portfolios;

## h discuss the effects that ability and willingness to take risk have on risk tolerance;

## i discuss the major constraint categories included in an individual investor’s investment policy statement;

### Time horizon

- While there are no precise definitions in the reading assignments,
  -  15 years or more is typically considered long term 
  -  short term usually three years or less. 

- In addition, many time horizons are multistage.
- A stage in the time horizon is indicated any time the individual experiences or expects to experience a change in circumstances or objectives significant enough to require evaluating the IPS and reallocating the portfolio.

### Liquidity

Spending needs that will be met by the investment portfolio (i.e., do not consider spending needs that will be met by salary or other income sources). Assume the client will use current income from the portfolio and/or liquidate assets as necessary to meet spending needs.

The liquidity of assets and of a resulting portfolio is a function of the transaction costs to liquidate and price volatility of the assets. 

Clients’ needs for liquidity include:

- Ongoing, anticipated needs for distributions such as living expenses.
- Emergency reserves for unanticipated distributions could be appropriate if client specific and agreed to in advance. Otherwise they create a “cash drag” on portfolio return by continually holding assets in lower return cash equivalents. Holding three months to one year of the annual distribution in cash reserves could be reasonable if agreed to in advance.
- One-time or infrequent negative liquidity events requiring irregular distributions should be noted. Be as specific as possible as to when and how much is needed.
- Positive liquidity inflows not due to the portfolio assets should also be noted.
- Illiquid assets, such as those restricted from sale or those on which a large tax bill would be due on sale, should be noted.
- The client’s ownership of a home is generally an illiquid asset and could be noted here. Alternatively it is often recorded under unique.

### Taxes

Taxation is a global issue and must be taken into account when formulating an investment policy for an individual. 

Some general classifications of taxes are as follows:
- Income tax. Taxes paid, usually annually, on any form of income (e.g., wage,rental, dividend, interest).
- Capital gains tax. Taxes incurred on the appreciation at the sale of an asset that has increased in value.
- Wealth transfer tax. Taxes paid on the total value of assets transferred to another individual through inheritance, gifts, et cetera.
- Personal property tax. Taxes paid on value of an asset (e.g., automobiles, real estate)

The following strategies are used to reduce the adverse impact of taxes:
- Tax deferral
- Tax avoidance
- Tax reduction
- Wealth transfer taxes
