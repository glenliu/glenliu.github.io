Covered call:
--------------------
> S - C

Protective put:
--------------------
> S + P ( = C + Ke^-rt => fiduciary call)

Put-call forward parity
--------------------
> Fe^-rt + p = c + Ke^-rt

 Day count and compounding conventions vary among different financial instruments. There are three variations used in the CFA curriculum:

 - All LIBOR-based contracts such as FRAs, swaps, caps, floors, etc:
360 days per year and simple interestMultiply "r" by days/360

- Equities, bonds, currencies, and stock options:
365 days per year and periodic compound interest
Raise (1+r) to an exponent of days/365

 - Equity indexes:
365 days per year and continuous compounding
Raise Euler's number "e" to an exponent of "r" times
days/365
