The present value of the expected loss is the most important of the credit risk measurements because it represents the exact dollar difference one should pay or receive for a bond relative to an otherwise identical and riskless government bond. The calculation of the present value of the expected loss in the reduced-form model includes the probability of default, the loss given default, the time value of money, and the risk premium.
