    "|Observation 1: The equity premium should be larger than, and positively correlated with, the corporate bond premium.|Correct|because given inferior consumption hedging properties, equity investors should demand a risk premium relative to fixed-income investors. Equity risk premiums tend to be highly correlated with corporate bond spreads.|\n",
    "|Observation 2: Corporate profitability is a leading economic indicator.|Correct|corporate profitability tends to sharply recover with any uptick in demand during a recession given leaner cost structures at that time and can be an important indicator of the business cycle.|\n",
    "|Observation 3: Equities provide superior consumption-hedging properties to high-quality bonds.|Incorrect|Because of the pro-cyclicality of economies and corporate profits, equities are not a good hedge against bad consumption outcomes, which is one of the reasons equity investors require a risk premium.|\n",
